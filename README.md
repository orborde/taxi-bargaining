[Taxi Industry Regulation, Deregulation, and Reregulation: The Paradox of Market Failure](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241306) mentions the following unstable bargaining game:

> For example, say that three strangers are willing to pay up to $7 each for a
> cab to the airport. Two cabs stop nearby. Each cab can carry one or two
> passengers, and each driver is willing to make the trip (with either one or
> two passengers) for a minimum of $6. Given these demands and costs, the

I decided to test the existence of this instability by exhaustion.
